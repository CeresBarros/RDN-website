    "text": "Environments are always changing, and the response of a social, political, economic-financial, ecological, or coupled system experiencing such perturbations can have important consequences. A system might remain relatively unaffected by perturbations, or a system might change. For example, a food production system might be resilient to drought, such that yield is relatively unaffected. Or it might lack resilience so that drought causes a great reduction in yield.\nOne important feature of a system that determines its resilience, is the variation in how its components respond to perturbations. This variation in responses is known as ‘response diversity’. It is implicated in the resilience of many kinds of systems to perturbations, including food production systems, financial systems, ecosystems, health systems, and communications systems, to name but a few (e.g. Walker et al 2023).\nHowever, the ways in which response diversity is studied and measured are diverse and span across multiple systems, scales, and environments. Because of this, our understanding of whether there are general “rules” and “metrics” with respect to response diversity is still limited. There is considerable untapped potential for the assessment and monitoring of response diversity, and for response diversity to be included in decisions that impact the future of the numerous systems mentioned above."

The discussion was titled: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket - response diversity as a crisis management sustainability strategy. An outline should soon be on the Globe-EU website.\nI then chatted with Céline Tschirhart who is a Scientific Policy Officer working in the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM) to the European Union. The SAM is an important way in which scientific advice can be provided to the European Union.\nHere are three opportunities for you to help:\n\nI would be very grateful if those of you that are active in such realms of providing advice to policy makers, in the EU or elsewhere, would please drop me a line if you’re interested in helping us activate the RDN more in that direction. (We might then collate information and provide it to all RDN members.)\nThere will be a meeting in Brussels on 24th November 2023, Thomas is planned to be the main speaker, and participants be diverse and include policy makers and scientists. It will concern the importance of response diversity in the context of strategic crisis management. Please let me know if you’re interested in attending in person or online.\nThe SAM works through the national academies of science, so you could contact your respect national academy of science and make them aware of you, the network, the importance of response diversity, and your willingness to help. Please let me know if you do this, so we can stay well coordinated.\n\nMany thanks and best wishes, Owen"

It also provided a stage on which to see opinion about what is response diversity. The opinions were broad and highlighted a need for further work on this. The symposium lies in the broader efforts of the recently formed Response Diversity Network which the organisers of the proposed session represent. We would like to give great thanks to the organisers of the GfO meeting. It was a fantastic meeting with excellent content and organisation. Thank you.\nHere’s some short information about each of the six excellent talks. Please contact the speakers if you’d like to learn more and discuss.\n\n\nAlain Danet, University of Sheffield\n\nAlain presented his work based on a bioenergetic food-web model. He investigated the effects of environmental stochasticity and response diversity on temporal stability of community biomass.\n\n\n\nSofia J. Van Moorsel, University of Zurich\n\nSofia presented the results from a recent experiment where beech tree seedlings coming from multiple locations over Europe were exposed to a simulated drought. They measured plants’ responses to drought looking whether tree coming from different geographic locations (and thus differing in their genotypes) show different responses to drought.\n\n\n\nMike Fowler, Swansea University\n\nMike presented work response diversity to a feature of temporal fluctuations in temperature (or any environmental variable). This feature is the colour of the flucutations, with reddened fluctuations being when current temperature is relatively similar to recent temperature. He found evidence of response diversity to the colour of the flucutations.\n\n\n\nLina Mühlbauer, University of Graz\n\nLina presented results of the ClimGrass experiment in which carbon dioxide, temperature, and drought were manipulated. Results shows that one feature of the response diversity of a community – the richness-evenness relationship, was altered by the treatments, despite there being no clear effects on either richness or evenness alone.\n\n\n\nShyamolina Gosh, University of Zurich\n\nShyamolina exposed her work investigating how temperature change and biodiversity affect community stability in birds and fish. She found that increasing variation in species response to temperature change (i.e., response diversity) decreased overall community synchrony. On the other hand, increasing extreme temperature led to more variability among species’ thermal tolerance limits which reduced interspecific synchrony at the extremes for birds.\n\n\n\nConor Waldock, University of Bern\n\nBy inferring environmental effects on occurrence using explainable AI, Conor was able to reveal response diversity to some environmental drivers, such as temperature, but less to others, such as river discharge."

    "text": "Left is a photo of summer in the Alps.\n\n\n\nScope of network\nThe founders of the network were mostly ecologists, and although they had broad interests, the network’s perspective on response diversity research was rather ecologically dominated. Inspired by the paper Response diversity as a sustainability strategy, by Brian Walker et al., published in early 2023) the network has taken steps to expand its scope. It now has numerous authors of that paper as members, and has revised its web pages. How to get involved: We still have work to do to represent a wider variety of response diversity research. You can help by pointing out what we might have missed (to Owen or Sam, for example).\n\n\nMembership\nOur numbers have grown again! This happened despite the Steering Committee focusing mainly on other activities, rather than putting large efforts into recruiting new members! How to get involved: If you have the opportunity, please publicise the network. You could grab a relevant slide from slides Sam made available. Get various versions of the logo from here.\n\n\nPositioning paper\nThe Steering Committee is writing an introductory paper describing the Network and its goals. As part of this, we are designing a survey of experts to gauge the current scope and state of response diversity research and researchers’ attitudes towards/opinions about response diversity. How to get involved: Please keep an eye out for (and respond to) the response diversity survey, which will be sent to all Network members and corresponding authors of relevant papers later this Summer.\n\n\nResponse diversity at the GfO meeting in Leipzig\nThe network will be present, so if you’re coming to the meeting then please let’s meet up! There is the Symposium, with six great speakers (Mike Fowler, Shyamolina Gosh, Lina Mühlbauer, Conor Waldock, Sofia van Moorsel, & Alain Danet). Also, we will have a social on Tuesday evening. Please drop Owen a line if you’d like to come, so we can know numbers and organise something appropriate. How to get involved: Come to the Symposium, come to the social :)\n\n\nWorkshop at OIST in March 2024\nThere will be a response diversity workshop held in Okinawa, Japan, 26-28 March 2024. The Ecological Society of Japan’s Annual Meeting will also take place earlier in March in Yokohama, so visitors may wish to attend both events. How to get involved: Preliminary invitations were sent last year to a range of members to encourage those from a range of backgrounds to attend (expenses covered). More formal invitations will be extended soon. Additional participants are welcome to join (more details coming soon), though due to limited funds, we cannot fund additional participants. We also encourage people to attend the Ecological Society of Japan meeting, and perhaps to organise a session (details coming soon).\n\n\nNetwork coordination\nIn the April newsletter, we mentioned an opportunity to propose a coordination office at the University of Zurich. Unfortunately, it was not possible to prepare a proposal in time, so we still look for opportunities to fund a coordination office. How to get involved: research possible funding opportunities and please let us know what you find.\n\n\nVirtual seminar series\nWe plan to launch a monthly virtual seminar series to give members the opportunity to connect and showcase their work. Because of our geographical distribution, we should be able to accommodate the speakers’ timezone and will record talks for anyone who cannot attend but wants to. How to get involved: please let us know if you’d be interested in being one of the first speakers (30-45 minute talks, as suits you!).\n\n\nConnect in person\nHow to get involved: Please reach out to Sam if there’s interest in meeting up at EAFES (Jeju, Korea), to Ceres or Hannah at BES Macro (Birmingham, UK), to Laura at ESA (Portland, USA), or Owen, Mike, or Takehiro at GFO (Leipzig, Germany) this Summer. We hope to see some of you in person soon!"

A list of persons to invite to this discussion was created to be as inclusive and broad as possible within fields of ecology, evolution and their related fields. It was clear, however, that membership of any network would need to be even more diverse than those invited.\nThose involved in the scoping discussions were enthusiastic about such a network, for its potential to coordinate meta-analyses, to overcome longstanding challenges, to coordinate the collection and curation of response traits, to help mix theory and empiricism, and because “networks are almost always a great thing!”. Numerous other opportunities and challenges were discussed and can be viewed in the notes from the scoping meeting pdf 0.1MB. The slides used in the chat are here pdf 4.9MB. Based on the enthusiasm and support expressed in the scoping discussions, the decision was made to start the network! Every network needs a logo, so we quickly got to work on that, and you can see the result in the top left of this web page."

Additional participants are welcome to join (more details coming soon), though due to limited funds, we cannot fund any additional participants. We also encourage people to attend the Ecological Society of Japan meeting, and perhaps to organise a session (details coming soon).\n\n\nPre-proposal for network coordination office in Zurich\nMany networks like ours have a coordination office. We have an opportunity to propose a coordination office at the University of Zurich. This is a fantastic opportunity to take the network to the next level, and a great time to do so while the network is quite young and still developing its identity, aims, and activities. Owen and Sam, supported by the steering committee will be working on a proposal over the next month or so. How to get involved: Please reach out to us if you’d like to help."

    "text": "Responsive diversity is a transversal concept and so the network is open to anyone who would like to be part of a community of people interested in any and all things about response diversity. It includes researchers working on many types of systems, problems, and settings, including ecological systems, coupled social-ecological systems, economic-policy-behavioural systems, natural resources, urban landscapes, and nature-people relationships, to name but a few. This diversity is also represented in the many ways in which our research is done, including case studies, theoretical models, large-scale observations, manipulative experiments, and data analyses.\nThe network is currently composed of about 80 members from 50 institutions in 24 countries. Current members include early career researchers (e.g. PhD candidates), researchers later in their careers, and everything in between."
