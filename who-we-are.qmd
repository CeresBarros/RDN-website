Responsive diversity is a transversal concept and so the network is open to anyone interested in being part of a community of people interested in any and all things about response diversity. It includes researchers working on many types of system, problem, and setting, including ecological systems, coupled social-ecological systems, economic-policy-behavioural systems, natural resources, urban landscapes, and nature-people relationships, to name but a few. This diversity is also represented in the many ways in which the research is done, including case studies, theoretical models, large scale observations, manipulative experiments, and data analysis.

The network is currently composed of about 64 members from 45 institutions in 22 countries. Current members include early career researchers (e.g. PhD candidates), researchers later in their careers, and everything in between.
