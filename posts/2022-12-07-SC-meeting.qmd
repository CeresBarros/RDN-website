The first meeting of the network steering committee was held on 7th December 2022 (meeting minutes available [here](https://github.com/ResponseDiversityNetwork/RDN-website/tree/main/assets/sc_meeting_mins)).
In brief, there was a update about membership, notification of a possible response diversity focused workshop in Japan in 2024, discussion of early priorities.
The decision was made to start work on a positioning report that would lay out the concept of and need for a Response Diversity Network.
The membership were informed and work began!
