    "text": "Environments are always changing, and the response of a system experiencing such perturbations can have important consequences. A system might remain relatively unaffected by perturbations, or a system might change. For example, a food production system might be resilient to a drought, such that yield is relatively unaffected. Or it might lack resilience, so that drought causes a great reduction in yield.\nOne important feature of the system that determines its resilience, is the variation in how its individual components respond to perturbations. This variation in responses is known as ‘response diversity’. It is implicated in the resilience of many kinds of systems to perturbations, including food production systems, financial systems, ecosystems, health systems, communications systems, to name but a few (e.g. Walker et al 2023).\nHowever, the ways in which response diversity is studied and measured are diverse and span across multiple systems, scales and environments. Because of this, our understanding of whether there are general “rules” and “metrics” with respect to response diversity is still limited. Furthermore, there is considerable untapped potential for assessment and monitoring of response diversity, and for response diversity to be included in decisions that impact on the future of the numerous systems mentioned above."

The process for such change should be as open and inclusive as possible."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On 4th October 2022 there was a scoping discussion about the prospects of a network to coordinate activities focused on and surround the concept of response diversity. A list of persons to invite to this discussion was created to be as inclusive and broad as possible within fields of ecology, evolution and their related fields. It was clear, however, that membership of any network would need to be even more diverse than those invited.\nThose involved in the scoping discussions were enthusiastic about such a network, for its potential to coordinate meta-analyses, to overcome longstanding challenges, to coordinate the collection and curation of response traits, to help mix theory and empiricism, and because “networks are almost always a great thing!”. Numerous other opportunities and challenges were discussed and can be viewed in the notes from the scoping meeting pdf 0.1MB. The slides used in the chat are here pdf 4.9MB. Based on the enthusiasm and support expressed in the scoping discussions, the decision was made to start the network! Every network needs a logo, so we quickly got to work on that, and you can see the result in the top left of this web page."
